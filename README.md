# Quasar App (quasar-todo-app)

A todo app to help you focus when you're feeling distracted, overwhelmed or unproductive.

## Background
I started this project to learn how to build apps using the Quasar framework - a cross-platform vue.js framework that supports PWAs: https://quasar.dev/. My key learnings from this project were the importance of reviewing and searching the documentation for in-built methods that will make my life easier! 

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Lint the files
```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```


### Format the files
```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```



### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
